## Description

My name is Peter Roman, and I created this portfolio so that I can showcase my personal and professional projects to the whole world. This portfolio is constantly updated whenever I learn new skills and work on new projects.

Thank you very much for checking it out and I hope you will have a great time!


## How To Use The Portfolio

This portfolio is a fully-responsive single-page application, which can be easily accessed by simply going to <https://peterroman.codes>. Once you're there, you are free to scroll down and discover its content.

The website is divided into four sections:
* Home section
* About section
* Projects section
* Contact section

You can use the navigation or the links in the Home section to skip to any particular section on the website.

The About section includes information about me, my work experience, skills and education. Each of these sub-sections is further divided into individual work experiences, tech skills, courses, etc. You can read about each of them, click the provided link to check out their website, and to access credentials I have gained for completing the displayed courses.

On desktop, the Projects section is an interactive projects gallery. As the list of projects appears on screen, a MacBook and an iPhone also make an appearance on screen. You can preview each project by moving your cursor over it (images of the project will show up on both the MacBook and the iPhone screens, allowing you to see how to project looks like on different screen sizes), and you can get more info about each project by clicking on them. Once a project is clicked, the list of projects disappears and more information about the chosen project appears. You can now read a detailed description of the project and to click on the provided buttons. Depending on the project, they might lead to the project's website itself, its source code, or its social media. To go back to the projects screen, click the "Back To Projects" button or any of the links in the navigation.

On mobile, the Projects section shows up as a list of projects I worked on that are stacked below one another. You can simply scroll down and view them all along. Each project comes with its own iPhone screen showing a preview of it, as well as a "Project Details" button, which toggles a detailed description of the project. Once again, each project comes with its own buttons which can take you to its website, source code, or social media.

Finally, the Contact section includes a chat window on the bottom, where you can see that a certain Peter Roman sends you text messages! He is very happy that you visited the portfolio and wants to connect. Inside the window, there are buttons which guide you on how to connect with me. ðŸ™‚
